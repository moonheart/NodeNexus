# Rust specific (for agent/ and backend/)
# These should ideally be in agent/.gitignore and backend/.gitignore if they were separate repos,
# but for a monorepo, putting them at the root prefixed with the directory is also an option
# or just relying on the global rules below.
# agent/target/
# backend/target/

# Cargo build artifacts (applies to both agent and backend)
**/target/
# Note: Cargo.lock is usually committed to version control for applications
# to ensure reproducible builds. For libraries, it's often ignored.
# Since backend and agent are applications, you might want to commit their Cargo.lock files.
# If you choose to ignore them globally (less common for apps):
# Cargo.lock

# Node.js / Frontend specific (for frontend/)
